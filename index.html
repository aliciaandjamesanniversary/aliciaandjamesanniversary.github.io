- Review pull requests


Go to the GitHub settings tab of the repository and be sure these settings
are appropriate for your project.

   ### Integrations
]
.right-column[

  There are a number of available resources that are freely available
  to Open Source projects. Many of these sites are already configured
  to access the code in HealthPartnersOSS.

  - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/HealthPartnersOSS/)
  - [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/gh/HealthPartnersOSS/)
  - [Bintray](https://bintray.com/HealthPartnersOSS)
  - [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/HealthPartnersOSS/snogo)
  - Many more! Just ask for the integration to be setup.

   ### Integrations
]
.right-column[
  Open source integration options are vast. There are many tools to help
  you get started down this path.

  - Check out our [existing](https://github.com/HealthPartnersOSS/snogo)
  [projects](https://github.com/HealthPartnersOSS/jenkins-shared-library-test-helper)
  - Check out tools that other open source projects use
  - Access is generally granted via OAuth to a GitHub account, so getting your
  account attached to the HealthPartners organization will allow you
  to access other resources as well

  ### Integrations
]
.right-column[

  The workflow for an open source project generally consists of the following

- Build in Travis CI
- Code coverage in CodeCov
- Release binaries in bintray or GitHub release
- Get badges for the project in the README,
check out [shields.io](https://shields.io/)

   ### Managing Contributions
]
.right-column[
  Contributions may come in from outside the HealthPartners organization.
  This is great! It means that we have had an impact outside of our walls.

- Make sure permissions are set so pull requests must be
reviewed by someone with access
- Provide some triaging information when an issue or PR is submitted
- If the repository is no longer maintained, archive the repository.

   ### The Open Source Landscape
]
.right-column[

  Most open source projects do not make a large impact, but rather
  gain a small community of contributors and users.

- We will need to evaluate what to do if a project becomes more popular
- Contributing to other open source projects, especially ones we use for work
is highly encouraged
- Be polite, respectful of others time, and professional
